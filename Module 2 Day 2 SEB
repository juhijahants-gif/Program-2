#Aim:

   To write a Python program that calculates and displays the sum of the first N natural numbers using a function.

#Algorithm:

#Step 1:

    Take input N from the user, representing how many natural numbers to sum.
    
#Step 2:

   Define a function sum_natural_numbers(n) 
   
#Step 3:

   Initializes a sum variable to 0.
   
#Step 4:

    Uses a loop from 1 to n inclusive to add each number to sum.
    
#Step 5:

   Returns the sum.
   
#Step 6:

   Call the function with the user input N.
   
#Step 7:

    Display the returned sum.

#Program:
```
def sum(n):
    return n*(n+1)//2
n=int(input())
result=sum(n)
print("The sum of first n natural numbers is",result)
```

#output:
<img width="1141" height="264" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-18 195754" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb536e80-f202-4d44-8034-dea067d56f39" />

#Result:

  The program successfully finds the sum of natural numbers
