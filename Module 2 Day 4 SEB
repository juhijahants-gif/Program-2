#Aim:

   The aim is to write a Python program that prints a pyramid pattern of numbers based on user input for the number of rows.

#Algorithm:
#Step 1:

   Take input from the user for the number of rows (n).
   
#Step 2:

   For each row i from 1 to n
   
#Step 3:

   Print spaces to align the row in pyramid shape (number of spaces = n - i).
   
#Step 4:

   Print numbers from 1 to i with spaces in between.
   
#Step 5:

  Move to the next line after each row is printed.
#Program:
```
num=int(input())
for i in range(1,num+1):
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        print(j,end=" ")
    print()
```
#Output:
<img width="1136" height="501" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-18 201901" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7570c691-2cac-4e54-95b1-62ed565e70a7" />
#Result:

  The program successfully prints the given pattern
