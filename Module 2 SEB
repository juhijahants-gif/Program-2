#Aim:

  The aim is to write a Python program that checks whether a given number is even or odd and displays the appropriate message.

#Algorithm:
#Step 1:

   Accept a number as input from the user.
   
#Step 2:

   Use the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
   
#Step 3:

  If the remainder is 0, the number is divisible by 2 and hence even.
  
#Step 4:

  Print "<number> is even".
  Else, the number is odd.
  
#Step 5:

  Print "<number> is odd".
#Program:
```
num=int(input())
if num%2==0:
    print(num,"is even")
else:
    print(num,"is odd")
```
#Output:

#Result:

  The program successfully checks the given number as even or odd
